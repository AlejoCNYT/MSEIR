# MSEIR Simulator

This is a MSEIR (Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) pandemic simulator created in Python using Pygame. The MSEIR model divides the population into four groups: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), and Recovered (R). The simulation takes into account various parameters such as exposure rate, infection rate, recovery rate, and mortality rate.

## Overview
The program simulates the movement and interaction of individuals within a population, visually displaying their health status on the screen. Individuals can be in one of the following states: Susceptible (S), Exposed (E), Infectious (I), or Recovered (R). The simulation allows adjusting population parameters and observing how they affect the disease spread.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
